## Level 1  

### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing  

1. **Dataset Inspection:**  
   - Explore the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns.  

2. **Missing Value Handling:**  
   - Identify missing values in each column and apply suitable imputation techniques.  

3. **Data Type Conversion:**  
   - Convert data types as necessary for analysis and modeling.  

4. **Target Variable Analysis:**  
   - Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate Rating").  
   - Check for class imbalances.  

---

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis  

1. **Statistical Measures:**  
   - Calculate key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.  

2. **Categorical Variable Analysis:**  
   - Explore variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."  

3. **Top Cuisines and Cities:**  
   - Identify the most frequent cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.  

---

### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis  

1. **Restaurant Locations:**  
   - Visualize restaurant locations using latitude and longitude data on a map.  

2. **Distribution Analysis:**  
   - Examine the distribution of restaurants across cities and countries.  

3. **Location vs. Ratings Correlation:**  
   - Analyze any potential relationships between a restaurant's location and its rating.  

---

## Level 2  

### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery  

1. **Availability Analysis:**  
   - Determine the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.  

2. **Ratings Comparison:**  
   - Compare average ratings of restaurants with and without table booking.  

3. **Delivery by Price Range:**  
   - Analyze the availability of online delivery for restaurants across different price ranges.  

---

### Task 2: Price Range Analysis  

1. **Common Price Range:**  
   - Identify the most common price range for restaurants.  

2. **Price Range Ratings:**  
   - Calculate average ratings for each price range.  

3. **Top Color Analysis:**  
   - Identify the color associated with the highest average rating in different price ranges.  

---

### Task 3: Feature Engineering  

1. **New Features from Existing Data:**  
   - Extract additional features such as the length of restaurant names or addresses.  

2. **Categorical Encoding:**  
   - Create binary features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery."  

---

## Level 3  

### Task 1: Predictive Modeling  

1. **Regression Model:**  
   - Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating based on available features.  

2. **Train-Test Split:**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance.  

3. **Algorithm Comparison:**  
   - Experiment with algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to determine the best-performing model.  

---

### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis  

1. **Cuisine vs. Rating:**  
   - Analyze the relationship between cuisine type and ratings.  

2. **Popular Cuisines:**  
   - Identify cuisines with the highest number of customer votes.  

3. **High-Rating Cuisines:**  
   - Determine specific cuisines that tend to receive higher ratings.  

---

### Task 3: Data Visualization  

1. **Rating Distribution:**  
   - Create histograms, bar plots, and other visualizations for rating distribution.  

2. **Comparative Analysis:**  
   - Compare average ratings of different cuisines or cities using visualizations.  

3. **Feature-Target Relationship:**  
   - Visualize the relationship between features and aggregate ratings to uncover insights.  

---

## Deliverables  

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.  
- Statistical and descriptive analysis reports.  
- Geospatial visualizations of restaurant distributions.  
- Predictive model and performance metrics.  
- Insightful data visualizations and interpretation of trends.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Programming Language:** Python
